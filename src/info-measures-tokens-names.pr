NAMING METHODS COMPARISON
=========================

The method of creation names of the tokens used by Supernova exporters created doubles group names.
So this exporter uses deferent method of naming tokens. The method is based on the "origin" property of the token.

Fo debugging purposes, the following table shows the differences between the two methods.

{[ const currentBrand = ds.currentBrand() /]}
{[ const tokens = ds.tokensByType("Measure", currentBrand.id) /]}

{[ for token in tokens ]}

- Origin: {{ stringifyOutput(token?.origin) }}

- fixed method: {[ inject "token-name-render" context { "token": token } /]}

- Hopple Final Token Name: {{ nameFromOrigin(token) }}
